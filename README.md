# Battleship!

## An implementation of a *classic board game* developed following the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, and bundled using Webpack

### The game, first published in 1967 (and first played by me in 2012) is a simple strategy and naval combat game, which many might agree is a timeless classic.

### You can play the game (vs CPU) [here!](https://laldasji.github.io/battle-ship/)

## Features

- **Optimized CPU AI**: The AI is designed to make smart moves. After a successful hit, it intelligently targets adjacent squares to increase the chances of hitting other parts of the ship.
- **Drag-and-Drop Ship Placement**: Players can easily position their ships using a drag-and-drop mechanism, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience compared to keyboard-only ship placement methods.
- **Classic Battleship Gameplay**: Play the timeless strategic naval combat game with the traditional rules of Battleship. Sink your opponentâ€™s fleet before they sink yours!
- **Interactive Visuals**: Enjoy clear, easy-to-understand graphics that visually represent the grid, ships, and hits/misses, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

## About 'Batteship'

**Battleship** is a classic naval strategy game where two players take turns guessing the locations of each other's fleet. Each player *secretly* arranges their ships on a grid and attempts to sink their opponent's ships by calling out coordinates. The first player to successfully sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game. Itâ€™s a test of both strategy and luck as players attempt to outguess and *"outmaneuver"* each other.
